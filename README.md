## 📝 About Me ✨
___
Passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights 📈 that drive decisions, strategies, and innovations in the healthcare and financial sector. My experience, which spans across healthcare, education, logistics and e-commerce, allows me to bring a versatile and adaptive approach to problem-solving. My proficiency in data cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and predictive modelling is complemented by my ability to communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Furthermore, as a trained researcher, peer-educator and customer service professional, I am critical, analytical and possess exceptional communication and problem-solving skills for resolving client issues.

Outside work, I love to enjoy good jazz music 🎷 and stay abreast with recent advancements in data science and analytics. ✨
